# Elevvo Machine Learning Internship 🚀

This repository contains the work completed during the **Elevvo Machine Learning Internship**, a practical training program focused on applying data science and machine learning concepts to real-world datasets.

---

## 📋 Overview

The internship involved completing several machine learning tasks that span multiple levels of complexity — from fundamental regression and clustering models to advanced computer vision and deep learning projects.

Participants were required to complete:
- **3 tasks** for the 2-week internship  
- **4 tasks** for the 1-month internship  

All tasks were implemented using **Python** and standard ML libraries such as `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, and `Keras`.
